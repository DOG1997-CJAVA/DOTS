# DOTS
This is an Android-based mobile application for Digital Olfactory Test System (DOTS-APP), develop with android studio. DOTS-APP can be used to develop experimental paradigm for psychophysics-based olfactory identification tests. Psycjophysical responses  and timing sequence are recorded by DOTS-APP and exported in EXCEL format.  This application  is used with the Odor Delivery Device (ODD) developed by our team to provide olfactory stimulation developed by our team. However, it is possble to synchronize odor stimulations with user-developed odor delivery devices. For more infomation please contact. Details of the project are still being updated.
