# DOTS
This is an Android-based mobile application for olfactory function tests (DOTS), develop with android studio, which can complete psychophysics-based olfactory identification tests for clinical tests as well as daily research tests.
It can customize a number of test parameters and export a variety of test data. 
Submit questions and corrections are welcome. 
It is worth noting that this application needs to be used with the digital olfactory stimulation transmission instrument (DOTS-ODD) developed by our team, and it is controlled by wireless wifi. 
Details of the project are still being updated
